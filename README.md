Projectile motion is a fundamental physics workhorse heavily studied in classical mechanics. In this paper, the computational model for projectile motion with air resistance is presented. A user-friendly GUI, developed via Python, Matplotlib, and Tkinter, simulates projectile trajectories. This research describes the physics behind projectile motion, including kinematics and drag forces, and the computational methods used for the numerical solution of the equations. It further explains the Python code used in the simulation and describes the outlined algorithm. The study emphasizes the role of numerical methods in solving complicated equations of motion while also exemplifying a field where numerical analysis acts as a bridge between theoretical physics and real-world applications.
