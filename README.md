# Projectile-motion-simulator
Introduction 
Projectile motion is a two-dimensional motion where the only force acting upon it after being launched 
is gravity; therefore, it is taught extensively in physics. The simplest case deals with equations of motion 
wherein no air resistance is assumed. Applications in the real world require the inclusion of drag forces. 
Hence, this project models a simulation through numerical methods to solve an approximation of 
projectile motion by including the variables of initial velocity, angle of projection, and air density. 
Accounting for air resistance gives a more realistic simulation of projectile motion, which has 
significance in the areas of ba listics, sports physics, and aerospace engineering. In a l these fields, 
knowledge of how air resistance impacts motion is of utmost importance from military technology 
applications to space explorations. 
Abstract 
Projectile motion is a fundamental physics workhorse heavily studied in classical mechanics. In this 
paper, the computational model for projectile motion with air resistance is presented. A user-friendly 
GUI, developed via Python, Matplotlib, and Tkinter, simulates projectile trajectories. This research 
describes the physics behind projectile motion, including kinematics and drag forces, and the 
computational methods used for the numerical solution of the equations. It further explains the Python 
code used in the simulation and describes the outlined algorithm. The study emphasizes the role of 
numerical methods in solving complicated equations of motion while also exemplifying a field where 
numerical analysis acts as a bridge between theoretical physics and real-world applications. 
Theory and Mathematical Model 
Kinematics of Projectile Motion 
In an ideal vacuum, a projectile fo lows a parabolic trajectory. The motion can be described by: 
‚óè Horizontal motion: x=v0 
cos(ùúÉ)t 
‚óè Vertical motion: y=v0 
sin(ùúÉ)t-¬Ωgt2 
where: 
‚óè v0
 is the initial velocity, 
‚óè ùúÉ is the launch angle, 
‚óè g is the gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s¬≤), 
‚óè x, y represent the horizontal and vertical positions over time. 
Effect of Air Resistance 
Air resistance, or drag force, is a resistive force opposing motion through a fluid. It is given by: 
Fd
 =¬ΩCd
 œÅAv2 
where: 
‚óè Cd 
is the drag coefficient (typica ly 0.47 for a sphere), 
‚óè œÅ is the air density (kg/m¬≥), 
‚óè A is the cross-sectional area of the projectile, 
‚óè v is the velocity magnitude. 
This force has both horizontal and vertical components, affecting acceleration in both directions. The 
motion equations are updated using Euler‚Äôs method: 
ax
 =(-Fd
 vx
 /mv)ay
 =-g-(Fd
 vx
 /mv) 
These equations are solved iteratively to update velocity and position over sma l time steps. This 
approach provides an approximation of the projectile's trajectory that closely resembles real-world 
scenarios.

Results 
The simulation i lustrates the real-world behavior of projectiles. It shows that: 
‚óè Higher air density results in less range and height. 
‚óè A launch angle near 45¬∞ would yield maximum range in the absence of air. 
‚óè Drag force strongly deviates the trajectory from the ideal parabolic path. 
‚óè The drag experienced by projectiles with larger cross-sectional areas influences their maximum 
height and travel distance. 
‚óè The longer the initial velocity, the greater the flight time and the horizontal range, but 
air-resistance effects during the flight are more pronounced due to higher speeds. 
The kind of numerical method in the simulation underscores the potential of computational methods in 
addressing complicated problems in physics. It a lows parameters to be altered dynamica ly so that the 
user can undertake various experiments and have an intuitive feel for how different factors are at play 
when it comes to projectile motion.

or even aerospace engineering. 
Linking computational physics with interactive visualization activates projectile motion understanding
